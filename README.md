# OpenElectroCardiogram
## Project Background
Initially a Hackathon Idea for [HackUNO2021](https://devpost.com/software/ekganalysistool). Later spawned into a research project in 2021-2022 with [Dr. Barton Willis](https://github.com/barton-willis).

## Goal
Utilize Julia and Numerical Analysis techniques to read and analyze EKGs/ECGs without the need for proprietary software.

TODO:
-  Expand file reading to use Open Standards such as: SCP-ECG, DICOM, and HL7 aECG
-  Develop a better understanding of how technicians analyze ECGs in the field.
  



## TODO
Add more flagging features
Improved UI, look into Gtk.jl

Export analysis, is the file size smaller?
